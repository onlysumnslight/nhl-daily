            <h2>Welcome back Sprong</h2>
            <h5>Nov 8th, 2024</h5>
            <p>The Seattle Kraken, who, in my opinion, are desperate for goal scoring make a move early in the season to reacquire Daniel Sprong from the Vancouver Canucks. <br> Sprong, who was on the team in 2022-2023, had his best season with 46 points in 66 games looks to tap back into that form and bring life into this Kraken team. <br> | Sprong traded to Kraken by Canucks |</p>
